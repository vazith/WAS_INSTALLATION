1. In Was While Doing Jms .. we are selecting Stores is File store & data store
   If we use data store where it store messages in database ...? 
   IF we use File store where it store Jms messages .... ?

Ans. If create one custome node and and server with name of data_store for removeing
      confusion we give server name datastore .. After that i depolyed one application 
      (SendJms)Application
     If we are selecting the datastore ..before that we have one active database ..without 
     database we can't select the data_Store 

     First add one database To Was ( configuration )

(IT SHOWS) Introduction

This wizard assists you in securing your bus.

In order to enable bus security you need to have administration security enabled for the cell the bus is defined in.

If this has not yet been done, clicking next will launch the Security Configuration Wizard for the cell.
Once that has been configured that wizard will return to this one, so bus security can be configured.

                V
              NEXT
                |
                V
(IT SHOWS ) Specify transport level security

Enabling bus security ensures the following:

   . Client applications can authenticate to the bus
   . The authorization policy for the bus is enforced
   . Peer messaging engines need to authenticate to each other

It does not ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data, for this secure transports are required. 
This can be achieved either by having a secure network, or by requiring that clients, and messaging engines 
make use of encrypted transports (i.e. SSL) when communicating. 
In order to force clients to use encrypted transports the bus can be configured to require clients use SSL.ENA
   ENABLED  -->    Require clients use SSL protected transports 
                         |
                         V
                        NEXT 
                         |
                         V
 You are configuring a bus that consists of bus members that are all Version 7 and above. You can therefore configure the bus to use a security domain other than the global security domain.

If the bus uses a domain other than the global security domain then you cannot add members that are earlier than version 7 to this bus.


   Use the global security domain


(.)Inherit the cell level security domain

 
 ( Use an existing security domain
  NONE )
    
Create a new security domain

Tune performance parameters

To improve performance of messaging within the application server, 
the proposed Java Virtual Machine settings are advised. By default the initial and maximum
JVM settings will remain unchanged, select the 'Change heap sizes' checkbox to modify the settings to the proposed values.
On machines with low amounts of physical memory size or large numbers of application server instances, 
it maybe necessary to reduce the proposed values accordingly.
