-Asynchronous Beans:
      1.Timer Managers
      2.Work Managers:



Asynchronous Beans:

    Purpose: Enable execution of tasks in the background, separately from the main thread of execution.
    Benefits: Improve responsiveness, avoid blocking primary threads, handle long-running operations efficiently.
    Implementation: Typically defined as EJBs using either the @Asynchronous annotation or the javax.ejb.Asynchronous interface.

Timer Managers:

    Purpose: Schedule and manage timer-based events within WAS.
    Capabilities:
        Create timers to trigger tasks at specific times or intervals.
        Manage timer persistence for reliability.
        Handle timer expiration events and invoke associated logic.

Work Managers:

    Purpose: Control how tasks are allocated to threads and manage thread pool resources.
    Key Features:
        Define thread pools with specific configurations (size, priority, etc.).
        Assign tasks to appropriate thread pools based on workload and priorities.
        Manage thread life cycles and optimize resource usage.

Application Example Using Work Manager:

Scenario: A web application processing customer orders with different priority levels.

Solution:

    Define Work Managers:
        Create two work managers: "highPriority" for urgent orders and "default" for regular orders.
    Configure Thread Pools:
        Assign more threads and higher priority to the "highPriority" work manager.
    Submit Tasks:
        When an order arrives, determine its priority and submit it to the appropriate work manager:
            High-priority orders: WorkManager.getInstance("highPriority").schedule(orderProcessingTask)
            Regular orders: WorkManager.getInstance("default").schedule(orderProcessingTask)
    Manage Task Execution:
        WAS allocates threads from the respective pools to execute tasks based on availability and priorities.

Benefits of Using Work Manager:

    Improved performance: Prevents bottlenecks by allocating resources efficiently.
    Prioritized task execution: Ensures urgent tasks are handled promptly.
    Enhanced control: Provides fine-grained management of thread usage and workload distribution.
    Scalability: Can be adjusted to meet changing application demands.

When to Use Work Manager:

    Handling multiple long-running tasks concurrently.
    Prioritizing tasks based on business needs.
    Optimizing resource usage for different workloads.
    Ensuring responsiveness under heavy load.
    Managing background tasks for maintenance or cleanup operations.
