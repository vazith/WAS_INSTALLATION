(IT SHOWS) Introduction

This wizard assists you in securing your bus.

In order to enable bus security you need to have administration security enabled for the cell the bus is defined in.

If this has not yet been done, clicking next will launch the Security Configuration Wizard for the cell.
Once that has been configured that wizard will return to this one, so bus security can be configured.

(IT SHOWS ) Specify transport level security

Enabling bus security ensures the following:

   . Client applications can authenticate to the bus
   . The authorization policy for the bus is enforced
   . Peer messaging engines need to authenticate to each other

It does not ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data, for this secure transports are required. 
This can be achieved either by having a secure network, or by requiring that clients, and messaging engines 
make use of encrypted transports (i.e. SSL) when communicating. 
In order to force clients to use encrypted transports the bus can be configured to require clients use SSL.

 You are configuring a bus that consists of bus members that are all Version 7 and above. You can therefore configure the bus to use a security domain other than the global security domain.

If the bus uses a domain other than the global security domain then you cannot add members that are earlier than version 7 to this bus.


   Use the global security domain


(.)Inherit the cell level security domain

 
 ( Use an existing security domain
  NONE )
    
Create a new security domain
