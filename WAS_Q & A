1 .WHAT IS WEBSPHERE ?
WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER WAS DEVOLPED BY IBM. IT WAS ONE OF THE SERVICE PRODUCT OF IBM . IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT HAVING HIGH PERFORMANCE
TRANSCATION ENGINE WHICH COULD BE HELP TO RUN AND INTEGRATE AND MANAGE THE BUSSINESS DYANAMIC APPLICATION. AND IT CAME WITH JAVA EE PLATFORM  
IN THAT PLATFORM WE CAN DEVOLP AND DEPLOY AND TEST AND MANAGE JAVA APPLICATIONS .WEBSPHERE  APPLICATION SERVER IS RESPONSILABLE FOR RUN AND
HOST THE APPLICATION.IT ACTS AS MIDDLE TIER WHICH HANDOVER REQUEST FROM CLIENT AND COLLECT THE FROM DATABASE BACKEND AND SEND REPOSNE TO THE
USER .AND IT CAME WITH FEATURES LIKE CONNECTIONPOOLING CLUSTERING AND CACHYEING AND DYANAMIC CACHEYING WHICHCOULD BE HELP TO INCREASE THE 
PERFORMANCE OF APPLIACTION WITH HIGH SCALABLITY AND HIGH AVAILABLITY  


2. IF WE TRIED TO CREATE A SERVER WITHOUT ADDING A NODE IT SHOWS ?
Error There are no nodes that support servers in the configuration. Use the addNode command from the Nodes collection orfrom the 
command line before attempting to create a new server.

3. where we can remove password of DMGR CONSOLE if we need ?
path: /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr02/config/cells/vazithCell01
vi security.xml 
4th line (change enabled="false")
REFERANCE ---> (" useLocalSecurityServer="true" useDomainQualifiedUserNames="false" enabled="true" )
IT REMOVE THE PASSWORD FOR DMGR CONSOLE 

4. WHEN WE START THE DMGR IF ANY CASE THE DMGR WAS NOT STARTED IF ANY ERROR 
PATH:/OPT/IBM/WEBSPHERE/APPSERVER/PROFILES/DMGR/LOGS
    IT CREATED (STARTSERVER.LOG) INSIDE IT SHOW THAT ERROR

5. WHERE DMGR STARTED TIME RECORDS IN LOGS ?
path:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/DMERE/logs/dmgr
vi SystemError.log 
with mention of 
************ Start Display Current Environment ************
shows(when the dmgr started with date and time)
************* End Display Current Environment *************

6. WHEN WE HITZ THE DMGR CONSOLE WITH DEFAULT PORTS IT AUTOMATICALLY HITZ THE CONSOLE WITH SECURE PORTS
  WHERE IT ALL CERTIFICATEES STORED ?
  PATH:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/DMERE/etc
clientCert.arm              DummyClientKeyFile.jks    DummyServerKeyFile.jks    key.p12         trust.p12
DataPower-root-ca-cert.pem  DummyClientTrustFile.jks  DummyServerTrustFile.jks  serverCert.arm
--> CERTIFICATES WAS IN (clientcert.arm , serverCert.arm, DataPower-root-ca-cert.pem )


7. HOW CAN I ENABLE MY NODE AND SERVER AUTOMATE ITS  SYNCHRONIZATION ..?
HERE ARE THE STEPS TO ENABLE AUTOMATIC SYNCHRONIZATION OF NODES AND SERVERS IN WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER:

--> ENABLE AUTOMATIC SYNCHRONIZATION:

    ACCESS THE WEBSPHERE ADMINISTRATIVE CONSOLE.
    NAVIGATE TO SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION > NODES.
    SELECT THE DESIRED NODE.
    RIGHT SHOWS NODE AGENT. CLICK ON NODE AGENET,
    CLICK ON FILE SYNCHRONIZATION SERVICE.
    ENSURE THE AUTOMATIC SYNCHRONIZATION CHECKBOX IS SELECTED.

(THERE WE CAN AUTOMATE THE SERVER STARTUP SYNCHORNIZATION ALSO ..
 SAME AS ABOVE PATH )
--> ENABLE THE STARTUP SYNCHRONIZATION

IN THE SAME PATH 
WE CHANGE SYNCHRONIZATION INTERVAL TIME ( DEFAULT TIME : 1 MIN )


8.  DDEPLOYMENT MANGER KOCATION AND DEFALUT HEAPSIZE
 SYSTEMADMINSTARATION > DEPLOYMENTMANAGER 
    MAXIMUM HEAP SIZE  256 MB
    MINIMUM HEAP SIZE  248 MB


9. IN WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER AS I ADMIN ... WHAT THE REQUIREDMENT I TAKE FROM THE 
       CLIENT FOR JDBC CONNECTIVITY


To establish JDBC connectivity as a WebSphere Application Server admin, you'll 
need to gather specific requirements from the client.  Here's a breakdown of what to ask for:

1. Database Information:

    Database type: MySQL, Oracle, DB2, etc.
    Database server hostname or IP address: Where the database resides.
    Database name: The specific database to connect to.
    Database port: The port on which the database listens (usually 3306 for MySQL, 1521 for Oracle, etc.).
    Driver type: JDBC driver required for the chosen database (e.g., MySQL Connector/J, Oracle JDBC driver).
    Driver JAR location: Download or provide the path to the JDBC driver JAR file.

2. Authentication Details:

    Database username: User with access to the database.
    Database password: Password for the database user.
    Authentication schema (optional): Any specific authentication schemes like LDAP or Kerberos (if not using basic username/password).

3. Connection Pool Settings:

    Initial pool size: Initial number of database connections to create in the pool.
    Min pool size: Minimum number of connections to maintain in the pool even when idle.
    Max pool size: Maximum number of connections allowed in the pool simultaneously.
    Max idle time: How long an idle connection can stay in the pool before being closed.
    Other pool settings (optional): Timeout limits, retry attempts, etc.

4. Application Specific Needs:

    Data source name: The name you'll assign to the JDBC connection for reference within your application.
    Transaction isolation level: Whether transactions should be isolated, read-committed, etc.
    Other application-specific settings: Any additional customization required for the connection based on your application's needs.


9. HOW CAN REMOVE DMGR PASSOWRD WITHOUT USING SECURITY.XML FILLE ..?
CD PATH /OPT/ibM/WEBSPHERE/APPSERVER/PROFILES/DMGR/BIN
RUN THIS COMMANDS : wsadmin.sh -conntype NONE
